## Lie algebra from Lie group
### Approach via matrix Lie groups
Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $GL_{n}(F)$, so a Lie group. Then the associated Lie algebra is 
$$
\text{Lie}(G)=\{ X \in M_{n}(F) \;\vert\; e^{tX} \in G \;\; \forall t \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

### Approach via left invariant vector fields
Let $G$ be a Lie group, $X_{1_{G}} \in T_{1_{G}}G$ a tangent vector at the identity, and $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ the corresponding left invariant vector field generated by $X_{1_{G}}$. Since $X$ is complete, we have for any $g \in G$, a unique integral curve of $X$, $\gamma_{g}: \mathbb{R} \to G$ with $\gamma_{g}(0)=g$. 

One such integral curve is $\phi:=\gamma_{{1_{G}}}$ which is a homomorphism $\mathbb{R} \to G$, and hence a [[One-parameter subgroup|one-parameter subgroup]]. 

So $\mathfrak{g}$ can be considered as the tangent space $T_{1_{G}} G$ with the Lie bracket being the bracket of vector fields, evaluated at $1_{G}$.

### Homomorphisms
Let $f: G \to H$ be a Lie group homomorphism. Then the map $df=df_{1_{G}}: \text{Lie}(G) \to \text{Lie}(H)$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras. 

*Note that since the Lie group has the exponential as its one-parameter subgroup, this is map is in fact*
$$
df(X)=\frac{d}{dt} \vert_{t=0}\; f(\exp(tX))
$$

This map has the following properties:
1. $\exp(df(X))=f(\exp(X))$ for all $X\in \text{Lie}(G)$.
2. $\text{Lie}(\text{ker}(f))=\text{ker}(df)$.
3. If $\text{im}(f)$ is closed, then $\text{Lie}(\text{im}(f))=\text{im}(df)$.
	1. By the first isomorphism theorem, $G / \text{ker}(f) \to \text{im}(f)$ is an isomorphism.
4. If $H$ is closed, then $\text{Lie}(H)$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\text{Lie}(G)$.


## Lie group from Lie algebra
The group $G$ can be obtained from $\mathfrak{g}$ by the [[!Exponential and logarithm maps|exponential map]].

Note that this mapping isn't necessarily surjective, so we may not be able to recover all of $G$ from the $\exp$ map. The cases where it's surjective are:
- $G$ is connected and compact
- $G$ is connected and nilpotent
- $G = GL(n,\mathbb{C})$.

## Lie's theorems
1. If $G \cong H$ as Lie groups, then $\text{Lie}(G) \cong \text{Lie}(H)$ as Lie algebras.
	In fact, if $\text{Lie}(G) \cong \text{Lie}(H)$ and $G$ is simply connected, then $G \cong H$.
	**Proof:**
		*Suppose $G \cong H$. Then $\text{Lie}(G) \cong \text{Lie}(H)$.*

## Lie group
$U(n,\mathbb{C})$ is the group of $n\times n$ complex matrices with $U^* = U^{-1}$.
$SU(n,\mathbb{C})$ is the same with determinant $1$. 

Dimension is $n^2$ (over $\mathbb{R}$).
	- Complex $n\times n$ matrices have dimension $2n^2$ over $\mathbb{R}$ due to $\mathbb{C}\cong \mathbb{R}^2$. 
	- Unitarity has $n$ real constraints from the rows (or columns) being unit length and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ complex constraints from the rows (or columns) being pairwise orthogonal. So $n(n-1)=n^2-n$ real constraints.
	- The total number of real constraints is $n^2-n+n=n^2$.
	- So the dimension is $2n^2-n^2=n^2$ over $\mathbb{R}$.
Similarly to [[Special linear group|special linear group]], the dimension of $SU(n,\mathbb{C})$ over $\mathbb{R}$ is $n^2-1$.

They are matrix Lie groups.

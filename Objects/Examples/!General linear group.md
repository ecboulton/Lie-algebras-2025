## Lie group
$GL(n,F)$ is the group of $n \times n$ invertible matrices with entries in $F$. Any closed subgroup of $GL(n,F)$ is a Lie group, in particular a [[!Lie Group|matrix Lie group]].

Dimension is $n^2$ over $F$ since it is an open submanifold (via the continuous determinant map) of $M_n(F)$, which has dimension $n^2$.

### Topological structure
The topology comes from the matrix norm, which is $||\cdot||: F^{n^2} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, such that for all matrices in $M(n\times n,F)\cong F^{n^2}$ and scalars $\alpha \in F$,
- $||A||\geq 0$

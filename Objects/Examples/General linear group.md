## Lie group
$GL(n,F)$ is the group of $n \times n$ invertible matrices with entries in $F$. Any closed subgroup of $GL(n,F)$ is a Lie group, in particular a **matrix Lie group**. 

Dimension is $n^2$ since it is an open submanifold (via the continuous determinant map) of $M_n(F)$ which has dimension $n^2$.

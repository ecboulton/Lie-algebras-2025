## Group
The **Heisenberg group** is the group of upper unitriangular matrices in dimension $3$. $$
H(F):= \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
&   1 & c  \\
& & 1
\end{pmatrix} \; | \; a,b,c \in F \right\}
$$
This is a group, as the product and inverse of upper unitriangular matrices are upper unitriangular. Also, it's defined by polynomials $h_{ii}=1$; $h_{ij}=0$ for $i>j$; and $h_{ij}$ constant for $i<j$, so it is topologically closed.

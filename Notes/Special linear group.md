## Lie group
$SL(n,F)$ is the group of $n \times n$ matrices with determinant $1$. 

Dimension is $n^2-1$. 
	- This is because $n\times n$ matrices have dimension $n^2$ and enforce the single equation $\det(A)=1$, which is a reduction of dimension by 1.

It is a matrix Lie group.

## Lie algebra
$SL(n,F)$ is the level set $\det ^{-1} (1)$, so the tangent space at the identity is the kernel of the derivative $d \det$ at the identity. The derivative is $\mathrm{Tr}(X)$, so the tangent space at the identity (and hence the Lie algebra) is $$
\mathfrak{sl}(n,F)=\{ X \in M(n,F) \; | \; \mathrm{Tr}(X)=0 \}
$$

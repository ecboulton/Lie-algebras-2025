Broadly, the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of the Lie group $G$ determines everything that happens in a small neighbourhood of $1_{G} \in G$. That is, $\mathfrak{g}$ knows $G$ locally.
## Lie functor
**TODO: define, describe morphism behaviour**


### Lie group from algebra
The map $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$ can recover some, but not necessarily all, of $G$. That is, it may not be surjective.
**TODO: obtain Lie group from algebra, when it is possible**
### Lie algebra from group
#### Approach via left invariant vector fields (general case)
Let $G$ be a Lie group, $X_{1_{G}} \in T_{1_{G}}G$ a tangent vector at the identity, and $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ the corresponding left invariant vector field generated by $X_{1_{G}}$. Since $X$ is complete, we have for any $g \in G$, a unique integral curve of $X$, $\gamma_{g}: \mathbb{R} \to G$ with $\gamma_{g}(0)=g$. 

One such integral curve is $\phi:=\gamma_{{1_{G}}}$ which is a homomorphism $\mathbb{R} \to G$, and hence a [[Notes/One-parameter subgroup|one-parameter subgroup]]. 

So $\mathfrak{g}$ can be considered as the tangent space $T_{1_{G}} G$ with the Lie bracket being the bracket of vector fields, evaluated at $1_{G}$.

#### Approach via matrix Lie groups
Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $GL_{n}(F)$, so a Lie group. Then the associated Lie algebra is 
$$
\mathfrak{g}=\text{Lie}(G)=\{ X \in M_{n}(F) \;\vert\; e^{tX} \in G \;\; \forall t \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$
The Lie bracket is the commutator.


## Local and global behaviour
Let $G$ be a matrix Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. There exists an open neighbourhood $0 \in U \subset \mathfrak{g}$ and an open neighbourhood $I \in V \subseteq G$ such that $\exp(U)=V$ is a homeomorphism.

### Local homomorphism
Let $\phi: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ be a homomorphism of Lie algebras. This induces a local homomorphism of Lie groups $\Phi: G \to H$ on the identity component of $G$, defined by $$
\Phi(e^X)=e^{\phi(X)}
$$
#### Proof (matrix Lie groups)
Let $\phi:\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ be a Lie algebra homomorphism, with $0 \in U \subset \mathfrak{g}$ and $I \in V \subset G$ such that $\exp(U)=V$ (i.e. the neighbourhoods where there is a local homeomorphism via $\exp$).

We claim $\Phi:G \to H$ defined by $\Phi(e^X)=e^{\phi(X)}$ is a Lie group homomorphism.

To see this, note (via [[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula|BCH]]) that the Lie algebra homomorphism $\phi$ satisfies $$
\begin{align}
\phi(\log(e^X e^Y)) &= \phi\left( X+Y+\frac{1}{2} [X,Y] +\dots \right) \\
&=\phi(X)+\phi(Y)+\frac{1}{2} [\phi(X), \phi(Y)]+\dots \\
&= \log(e^{\phi(X)} e^{\phi(Y)})
\end{align}
$$
So $$
\Phi(e^X e^Y)=\Phi(e^{\log(e^X e^Y)})=e^{\log(e^{\phi(X)} e^{\phi(Y)})}=e^{\phi(X)} e^{\phi(Y)}=\Phi(e^X) \Phi(e^Y)
$$

### Global homomorphism
For the local homomorphism $\Phi: G \to H$, we defined $\Phi=\exp \circ \phi \circ \log$ over the domain where $G,H$ and $\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{h}$ are locally homeomorphic.

Let $\eta: [0,1] \to G$ be a path with $\eta(0)=1_{G}$ and $\eta(1)=g$. Then there is $|t-s|<\delta$ such that $\eta(t)\eta(s)^{-1}\in V \subset G$. Define a partition $0<t_{1}<\dots<t_{m}=1$. 

For $g \in G$, define the global homomorphism as $$
\Phi(g):=\prod_{j=1}^m \Phi(\eta(t_{j-1})\eta(t_{j})^{-1})
$$
That is, the factors in $\Phi(g)$ are local homomorphisms on a small step along the path from $1_{G}$ to $g$. This works because the Lie algebra homomorphism respects the group structure in any local neighbourhood, and we can patch these neighbourhoods together.

*Note: due to the path, this only works on points which are path connected to the group identity. That is, it's global on the identity component.*

Alternatively (and more succinctly), because $\Phi$ is analytic (locally agreeing with a convergent power series), **analytic extension is possible over a connected, simply connected set**.


## Lie's three theorems
Let $G,H$ be Lie groups with corresponding algebras $\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{h}$.

### Lie's first theorem
If $G \cong H$, then $\mathfrak{g} \cong \mathfrak{h}$.

If $\Phi: G \to H$ is the isomorphism, then it induces an isomorphism $\phi: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ with $\phi(X)$ the unique matrix in $\mathfrak{h}$ such that $\Phi(\exp(tX))$ is its [[One-parameter subgroup|one-parameter subgroup]]. See [[Connecting Lie groups and algebras]].

### Lie's second theorem
If $\mathfrak{g} \cong \mathfrak{h}$, then $G$ and $H$ are locally isomorphic (there exists an isomorphism between neighbourhoods).

If $\phi: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ is the isomorphism, then it can be lifted to a local isomorphism $\Phi: G \to H$ defined by $\Phi(e^X)=e^{\phi(X)}$. See [[Connecting Lie groups and algebras]].

### Lie's third theorem
For every finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, there exists a unique simply connected Lie group $G$ with $Lie(G)=\mathfrak{g}$. 
Likewise, if $G$ is a simply connected Lie group, then $$
\text{Hom}_{LieGps}(G,H) \cong \text{Hom}_{LieAlgs} (Lie(G), Lie(H))
$$
#### Proof for matrix Lie groups
Using [[Lie algebra|Ado's theorem]], we know $\mathfrak{g}$ is a subalgebra of $M(n,\mathbb{C})$. Let $G:=\{ e^{X_{1}} \dots e^{X_{m}} \; | \; m \in \mathbb{N}, X_{i} \in \mathfrak{g}\}$. This is a simply connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is $\mathfrak{g}$.

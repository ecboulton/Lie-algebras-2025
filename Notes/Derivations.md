As a subalgebra of End(g) and ad_g as an ideal TODO

## Definition
Let $F$ be a field, $A$ a commutative unital $F$-algebra, and $M$ an $A$-module. An $F$-**derivation**, or just a **derivation**, is a $F$-linear map $X: A \to M$ satisfying Leibniz's rule, $X(ab)=aX(b)+bX(a)$. 

The **space of derivations** is $\text{Der}_{F}(A,M)$.

## Properties
Derivations can be used to construct the [[Tangent space|tangent space]].

## As a Lie algebra
Subalg of End(g) and it has ad_g as an ideal

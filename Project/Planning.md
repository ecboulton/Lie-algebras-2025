**TOPIC:** From representations of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ to classical modular forms and $L$-functions.

- How Lie group/algebra representations explain analytic structure of modular forms and their $L$-functions
- Worked example (Fourier expansion, weight 2 cusp forms, Hecke eigenvalues, Dirichlet series)
- How this generalises to the Langland's program

**KEY AREAS:** representation theory, automorphic forms

**LIE THEORY:** 
- $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ real Lie group acting smoothly on upper half plane by Moebius transformations
- Upper half plane isomorphism to $SL(2,\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$
- Representation theory of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, discrete series representations of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, modular forms connect to lowest weight vectors in discrete series representations
- Automorphic forms of reductive Lie groups
- Representations encode analytic data (spectral decomposition) and arithmetic data (Fourier coefficients, Hecke eigenvalues)
- Connection to Galois representations

**ARC:** start with Lie group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, see how it acts on $\mathcal{H}$, how the representations classify modular forms, how these forms encode number-theoretic information. Introduce Langland's correspondence.


**TECHNICAL:**
- Lie group $G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and action on upper half plane $\mathcal{H} \cong SL(2,\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$
- $\Gamma=SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, where $\Gamma$ denotes a discrete subgroup of $G$
- Automorphic form: function $F$ on $G$ such that

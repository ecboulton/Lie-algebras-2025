**Modular group** is $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ or $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z}):=SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) / \{ \pm I \}$ depending on convention.
Behaves as group of **fractional linear transformations** of the upper half plane.

$\mathcal{H}=\{ z \in \mathbb{C} \; | \; \text{Im}(z)>0 \}$

That is, $\begin{pmatrix} a & b  \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \leftrightarrow (z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d})$.

Reason to define as $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$: includes the identity map $z \mapsto z$ as corresponding to the identity matrix (clear connection between identities).

Reason to define as $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$: considers all scalar multiples of $I$ as the identity element, which removes ambiguity of scalar multiples being the same map. That is, it's actually an isomorphism.

IMO should be $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$.
